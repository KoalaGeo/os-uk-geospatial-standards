"As recognised in the 2008 UK Location Strategy, the UK would benefit from a common set of technical standards for geographic data. This would enable a common infrastructure, resulting in easier access and interoperability of the data from different organisations, and to different data users. Such a set of standards is not static; after agreeing an initial set, it will be important to have in place well resourced governance to continue to ensure that the standards are kept in step with changing technology and requirements. 

Other countries are benefitting from such a managed set of standards, e.g. Netherlands, United States. 

As the National Mapping Authority, Ordnance Survey (OS) regularly provides leadership to the existing work on geographic information standards, at the British Standards Institution (Chair & Secretary of their technical committee on GI: IST/36), Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC; only UK strategic member), and Association for Geographic Information (AGI, Chair & Secretary of their standards committee). Through these, OS also regularly takes a lead in international geographic standardisation, at ISO TC211, and at OGC – alongside BGS, DSTL, and the Met Office. Similarly, as one of the technical delivery partners for the UK’s response to INSPIRE, OS works alongside Defra, the Government Digital Service, the Scottish Government, and BGS on the technical aspects of implementing the current Spatial Data Infrastructure (SD) in UK. More widely, OS already has functioning relationships with the National Infrastructure Commission / Centre for Digital Built Britain’s National Digital Twin Initiative, directly with major infrastructure developers, and with the Government Digital Service. 

All this places OS in a good position to take a lead on establishing the initial consensus and developing a mechanism to manage it. 

Leaving the European Union provides both opportunity and threat in this area: the opportunity to evolve our national SDI and standard set to priorities our own UK requirements; the threat that without the governance / oversight currently provided by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, our national implementation loses the coherence that it has achieved in the past ten years. 

This work has started informally, under the auspices of the AGI, with just a single workshop facilitated by OS, involving the Geo6 organisations, plus Defra, Met Office, Ministry of Defence, Office of National Statistics, and OGC. 

Note: in this context at least, the definition of ‘standard’ includes the INSPIRE specifications and technical guidelines – which are maintained by consensus, and available free of charge to reuse. This technical work is independent of which UK body has the ‘policy lead’ for INSPIRE – this is currently Defra, supported by the devolved administrations, particularly the Scottish Government. 

Scope and approach 

Phase 1 – Consolidate an initial set of standards (6 months) 
- Agree priorities from the 10 standards & technical areas identified in the initial workshop, including: 
  - Which are stable 
  - Which need work, and where that work is best done 
- Check this with other data publishers, beyond the ten involved so far 
- Cross check this with data users, involving OGC and the Open Data Institute 
- Cross check with other national data infrastructure initiatives, including from the National Infrastructure Commission / Centre for Digital Built Britain, and the Government Digital Service 
- Agree what other areas would be essential or useful, for example common approaches to data quality – both improving quality and reporting it. 
- Determine which organisation in the UK, and overseas, is best placed to lead each work item 
- Forecast when it will be possible to have a mature enough initial set. Note: we may agree that what we have already is mature enough, even though some areas need work. "
